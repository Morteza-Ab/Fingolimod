**Senescence Analysis App**

This Shiny app provides an interactive platform to analyze transcriptome and proteome datasets across various comparison groups. The app offers multiple functionalities to aid in understanding gene expression patterns, identifying key features, and performing enrichment analysis.

**Features**


***Heatmaps***

Visualize gene expression patterns across different comparison groups with customizable heatmaps.

***Volcano Plots***

Display differential expression results, highlighting significantly upregulated and downregulated genes.

***PCA (Principal Component Analysis) Plots***

Explore the variation between samples and identify clustering patterns.

***Correlation Heatmaps***

View the correlation between samples to understand relationships within the dataset.

***Enrichment Analysis***

Perform enrichment analysis using:

***KEGG pathways***

***Gene Ontology (GO) Molecular Functions***

***GO Biological Pathways***

***Feature Selection***

Select relevant genes for classification using the BssWssFast method, which calculates the ratio of between-groups sum-of-squares to within-groups sum-of-squares. This univariate technique identifies the most important genes for classification in microarray data.

***Expression Heatmap for Selected Features***

Generate heatmaps for the selected genes based on their expression across different samples.
